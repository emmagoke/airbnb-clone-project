# Airbnb Clone Project 🏡

## Overview

This repository contains the backend implementation for an Airbnb Clone project. It's designed as a comprehensive learning platform to simulate building a robust, real-world booking application. The primary focus is on backend architecture, API development (RESTful and GraphQL), database design and optimization, application security fundamentals, and automated deployment pipelines (CI/CD). This project aims to provide hands-on experience with modern software development practices in a collaborative environment.

## 🏆 Project Goals

The key objectives for this backend system are:

- **User Management:** Implement secure user registration, authentication, and profile management features.
- **Property Management:** Develop functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting property listings.
- **Booking System:** Create a reliable mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage their bookings.
- **Payment Processing:** Integrate a system to handle booking-related payments.
- **Review System:** Allow users to submit and view reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data handling through techniques like indexing and caching.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Backend Framework:** Django & Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API Query Language:** GraphQL
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery
- **Caching/Session Management:** Redis
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI Standard
- **Automation:** CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions)

## 👥 Team Roles & Responsibilities

Based on the project's requirements and standard software development team structures, here are the key roles and their responsibilities within the Airbnb Clone project:

- **Backend Developer:**

  - **Focus:** Server-side logic, APIs, and database interaction.
  - **Responsibilities:** Implements the core business logic for features like user management, property listings, bookings, and payments. Develops, tests, and maintains the RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints. Collaborates with the DBA on database schema design and writes code to interact efficiently with the database (PostgreSQL). Ensures the backend application is performant and scalable.

- **Database Administrator (DBA):**

  - **Focus:** Database health, design, and performance.
  - **Responsibilities:** Designs the logical and physical database schema for PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity and normalization. Implements performance optimization strategies, including indexing and query tuning. Manages database security, access control, backups, and recovery plans. Works closely with Backend Developers to support data storage and retrieval needs.

- **DevOps Engineer:**

  - **Focus:** Automation, infrastructure, deployment, and monitoring.
  - **Responsibilities:** Sets up and manages the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes. Manages the application infrastructure, likely using containerization tools like Docker. Implements and maintains monitoring and logging solutions to track application health and performance. Ensures the application is scalable, reliable, and deployable in a consistent manner.

- **QA Engineer (Quality Assurance):**
  - **Focus:** Ensuring application quality and adherence to requirements.
  - **Responsibilities:** Develops and executes comprehensive test plans and test cases (both manual and automated) to verify the functionality of the backend APIs and business logic. Identifies, documents, and tracks bugs through to resolution. Validates that all features meet the specified requirements and quality standards before deployment. Advocates for quality throughout the development lifecycle.

## 💾 Database Design

This section outlines the basic database schema design for the Airbnb Clone project. It includes the key entities, important fields for each, and their relationships. This represents a simplified model focusing on core functionalities.
